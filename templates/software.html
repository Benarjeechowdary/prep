          Explain the difference between object-oriented and functional
          programming.
          <div id="answer-1" class="answer">
            OOP models data as objects with properties and behaviors, while
            functional programming focuses on using pure functions and immutable
            data.

        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(2)">
          How would you optimize a slow database query?
          <div id="answer-2" class="answer">
            Use indexing, query optimization techniques, proper joins, and
            caching to improve performance.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">

          How does garbage collection work in Java/Python?
          <div id="answer-4" class="answer">
            Garbage collection automatically frees up memory by removing objects
            that are no longer referenced.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(5)">

          <div id="answer-5" class="answer">
            SOLID stands for Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov
            Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.

          What is a deadlock in multithreading?
          <div id="answer-6" class="answer">
            A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each
            other to release resources, causing a standstill.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(7)">
          How does HTTP differ from WebSockets?
          <div id="answer-7" class="answer">
            HTTP is a request-response protocol, while WebSockets allow for
            full-duplex communication over a single connection.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(8)">
          Explain how hashing works in data structures.
          <div id="answer-8" class="answer">
            Hashing converts input data into a fixed-size hash value using a
            hash function to enable fast data retrieval.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(9)">
          What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?
          <div id="answer-9" class="answer">
            An interface defines a contract that implementing classes must
            follow, while an abstract class can have both abstract and concrete
            methods.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(10)">
          How would you handle memory leaks in an application?
          <div id="answer-10" class="answer">
            Use profiling tools, avoid circular references, and release unused
            objects to prevent memory leaks.
          </div>

        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(11)">
          Explain the purpose of Docker and Kubernetes.
          <div id="answer-11" class="answer">

          <div id="answer-12" class="answer">

          How do you handle API rate limiting?
          <div id="answer-14" class="answer">
            Use a token bucket or leaky bucket algorithm to control request
            rates and return appropriate status codes.
          </div>

        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(15)">
          What is the CAP theorem in distributed systems?
