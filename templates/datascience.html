        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(1)">
          What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
          <div id="answer-1" class="answer">
            Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while
            unsupervised learning finds patterns and structures in unlabeled
            data.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(2)">
          Explain the concept of overfitting and how to prevent it.
          <div id="answer-2" class="answer">
            Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but
            poorly on unseen data. Prevent it by using regularization, pruning,
            and early stopping.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">
          What are the key assumptions of linear regression?
          <div id="answer-3" class="answer">
            Linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality of residuals,
            and lack of multicollinearity.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">
          How do you handle missing data in a dataset?
          <div id="answer-4" class="answer">
            Use techniques like imputation (mean, median, or mode), removal of
            rows, or using models to predict missing values.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(5)">
          What is the curse of dimensionality in machine learning?
          <div id="answer-5" class="answer">
            The curse of dimensionality refers to the difficulty in modeling
            data as the number of features increases, leading to sparse data and
            overfitting.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(6)">
          Explain the difference between classification and regression.
          <div id="answer-6" class="answer">
            Classification predicts discrete labels, while regression predicts
            continuous values.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(7)">
          What are precision, recall, and F1-score?
          <div id="answer-7" class="answer">
            Precision = TP/(TP + FP), Recall = TP/(TP + FN), F1-score = 2 ×
            (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall).
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(8)">
          How do you evaluate the performance of a machine learning model?
          <div id="answer-8" class="answer">
            Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC,
            and confusion matrix.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(9)">
          What is cross-validation and why is it important?
          <div id="answer-9" class="answer">
            Cross-validation splits data into training and testing sets multiple
            times to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(10)">
          What is the difference between bagging and boosting?
          <div id="answer-10" class="answer">
            Bagging reduces variance by training models in parallel, while
            boosting reduces bias by training models sequentially.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(11)">
          Explain the working of a Random Forest algorithm.
          <div id="answer-11" class="answer">
            Random Forest creates multiple decision trees during training and
            outputs the mode (classification) or mean (regression) of the
            predictions.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(12)">
          What are some common feature engineering techniques?
          <div id="answer-12" class="answer">
            Scaling, encoding categorical variables, feature extraction,
            polynomial features, and missing value imputation.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(13)">
          How do you deal with imbalanced datasets?
          <div id="answer-13" class="answer">
            Use techniques like oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE, or adjusting
            class weights.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(14)">
          What is PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and when should you use it?
          <div id="answer-14" class="answer">
            PCA reduces the dimensionality of data while preserving variance.
            Use it to remove noise and improve model performance.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(15)">
          How does a convolutional neural network (CNN) work?
          <div id="answer-15" class="answer">
            A CNN uses convolutional layers to extract spatial features from
            images, followed by pooling and fully connected layers for
            classification.
