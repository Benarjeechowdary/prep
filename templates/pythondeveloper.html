          What are Python’s key features?
          <div id="answer-1" class="answer">
            Python is interpreted, dynamically typed, object-oriented, and
            supports multiple programming paradigms.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(2)">
          What is the difference between `is` and `==` in Python?
          <div id="answer-2" class="answer">
            `is` checks for object identity (whether two objects are the same in
            memory), while `==` checks for value equality.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">
          What are Python’s built-in data types?
          <div id="answer-3" class="answer">
            Common types include `int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, `tuple`, `set`,
            `dict`, and `bool`.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">
          Explain the concept of Python’s GIL (Global Interpreter Lock).
          <div id="answer-4" class="answer">
            The GIL ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a
            time, even on multi-core processors.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(5)">
          How does memory management work in Python?
          <div id="answer-5" class="answer">
            Python uses reference counting and garbage collection to manage
            memory.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(6)">
          What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?
          <div id="answer-6" class="answer">
            Lists are mutable (can be modified), while tuples are immutable
            (cannot be modified).
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(7)">
          How do you handle exceptions in Python?
          <div id="answer-7" class="answer">
            Use `try-except` blocks to catch and handle exceptions.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(8)">
          What is a Python decorator?
          <div id="answer-8" class="answer">
            A decorator is a function that modifies the behavior of another
            function or class.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(9)">
          Explain the difference between deep copy and shallow copy.
          <div id="answer-9" class="answer">
            A shallow copy copies references to objects, while a deep copy
            creates new objects recursively.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(10)">
          What is the purpose of `__init__` in Python classes?
          <div id="answer-10" class="answer">
            `__init__` is the constructor method used to initialize objects.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(11)">
          What are Python’s lambda functions?
          <div id="answer-11" class="answer">
            Lambda functions are anonymous functions defined using the `lambda`
            keyword.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(12)">
          How do you handle file operations in Python?
          <div id="answer-12" class="answer">
            Use `open()` to read/write files and `with` to manage file context.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(13)">
          What is the difference between `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, and
          instance methods?
          <div id="answer-13" class="answer">
            `@staticmethod` defines a method that doesn’t access the class;
            `@classmethod` takes the class as an argument; instance methods take
            `self` as the first argument.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(14)">
          What is a Python generator?
          <div id="answer-14" class="answer">
            A generator is an iterator that yields values one at a time using
            the `yield` keyword.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(15)">
          What is the difference between `None` and `False` in Python?
          <div id="answer-15" class="answer">
            `None` represents the absence of a value, while `False` is a boolean
            value.
