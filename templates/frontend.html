          What is the difference between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?
          <div id="answer-1" class="answer">
            HTML defines the structure of a webpage, CSS styles it, and
            JavaScript adds interactivity.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(2)">
          What are the different types of CSS positioning?
          <div id="answer-2" class="answer">
            The types are static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky
            positioning.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">
          Explain the box model in CSS.
          <div id="answer-3" class="answer">
            The box model includes margins, borders, padding, and the content
            itself.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">
          What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?
          <div id="answer-4" class="answer">
            `==` compares values after type conversion, while `===` compares
            values and types.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(5)">
          What are pseudo-classes in CSS?
          <div id="answer-5" class="answer">
            Pseudo-classes are used to define the special state of an element
            (e.g., `:hover`, `:first-child`).
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(6)">
          What is the purpose of `async` and `defer` in script tags?
          <div id="answer-6" class="answer">
            `async` loads the script asynchronously, while `defer` loads it
            after the HTML is parsed.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(7)">
          Explain the concept of responsive design.
          <div id="answer-7" class="answer">
            Responsive design ensures a webpage adapts to different screen sizes
            using media queries and flexible layouts.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(8)">
          What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript?
          <div id="answer-8" class="answer">
            `null` is an assigned value, while `undefined` means a variable has
            been declared but not assigned a value.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(9)">
          What is the purpose of the `z-index` property in CSS?
          <div id="answer-9" class="answer">
            The `z-index` property controls the vertical stacking order of
            elements.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(10)">
          What is the difference between `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and
          `cookies`?
          <div id="answer-10" class="answer">
            `localStorage` persists data with no expiration, `sessionStorage`
            persists until the tab closes, and `cookies` persist until
            expiration.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(11)">
          How do you improve website performance?
          <div id="answer-11" class="answer">
            Use lazy loading, minify CSS/JS files, enable browser caching, and
            reduce DOM size.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(12)">
          What are CSS media queries?
          <div id="answer-12" class="answer">
            Media queries allow you to apply styles based on the screen size or
            device type.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(13)">
          What is the Virtual DOM in React?
          <div id="answer-13" class="answer">
            The Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the real DOM used
            for efficient updates and rendering.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(14)">
          Explain the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const` in
          JavaScript.
          <div id="answer-14" class="answer">
            `var` has function scope, `let` and `const` have block scope, and
            `const` cannot be reassigned.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(15)">
          What is event delegation in JavaScript?
          <div id="answer-15" class="answer">
            Event delegation allows a parent element to handle events from its
            child elements using a single handler.
