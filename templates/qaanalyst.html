          What are the different levels of testing?
          <div id="answer-2" class="answer">

          Explain the concept of black box testing.
          <div id="answer-3" class="answer">
            Black box testing focuses on input and output without considering
            the internal code structure.

        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">
          What is regression testing and why is it important?

        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(5)">
          What are test cases and how do you write them effectively?
          <div id="answer-5" class="answer">
            Test cases are step-by-step instructions for testing a feature. They
            should be clear, concise, and cover positive and negative scenarios.
          </div>

        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(6)">
          What is the difference between functional and non-functional testing?
          <div id="answer-6" class="answer">
            Functional testing checks if the application works as expected,
            while non-functional testing evaluates performance, security, and
            usability.

          What is the purpose of automated testing?
          <div id="answer-7" class="answer">
            Automated testing reduces manual effort, increases test coverage,
            and allows for faster execution.
          </div>

        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(8)">
          Explain the concept of exploratory testing.
          <div id="answer-8" class="answer">
            Exploratory testing involves investigating the application without
            predefined test cases to discover defects.

          <div id="answer-10" class="answer">
            A defect is a flaw in code, an error is a human mistake, and a
            failure is the inability of a system to perform a required function.
