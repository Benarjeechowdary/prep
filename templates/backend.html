          What is REST and how does it work?
          <div id="answer-1" class="answer">
            REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style
            that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD
            operations on resources.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(2)">
          What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?
          <div id="answer-2" class="answer">
            SQL databases are relational, structured, and use a fixed schema,
            while NoSQL databases are non-relational, schema-less, and designed
            for scalability.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">
          Explain the concept of middleware in web frameworks.
          <div id="answer-3" class="answer">
            Middleware functions are used to process requests between the client
            and server, handling tasks like authentication, logging, and request
            validation.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">
          What are microservices?
          <div id="answer-4" class="answer">
            Microservices are an architectural style where an application is
            composed of small, independent services that communicate over HTTP
            or messaging protocols.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(5)">
          What is an API gateway?
          <div id="answer-5" class="answer">
            An API gateway manages and routes client requests to appropriate
            microservices, handling tasks like authentication, rate limiting,
            and load balancing.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(6)">
          What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous
          programming?
          <div id="answer-6" class="answer">
            Synchronous programming waits for a task to complete before moving
            on, while asynchronous programming allows other tasks to continue
            without waiting.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(7)">
          What is dependency injection?
          <div id="answer-7" class="answer">
            Dependency injection is a design pattern where an object receives
            its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them
            internally.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(8)">
          What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
          <div id="answer-8" class="answer">
            TCP is connection-oriented and guarantees delivery, while UDP is
            connectionless and does not guarantee delivery.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(9)">
          Explain the purpose of caching in a web application.
          <div id="answer-9" class="answer">
            Caching improves performance by storing frequently accessed data in
            memory to reduce load times and server requests.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(10)">
          What is a reverse proxy and why is it used?
          <div id="answer-10" class="answer">
            A reverse proxy sits between client requests and backend servers,
            improving security, load balancing, and caching.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(11)">
          What is the difference between a monolithic and a microservices
          architecture?
          <div id="answer-11" class="answer">
            A monolithic architecture is a single codebase, while a
            microservices architecture breaks down functionality into small,
            independent services.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(12)">
          What is JWT (JSON Web Token) and how is it used?
          <div id="answer-12" class="answer">
            JWT is a compact, URL-safe token used to securely transmit
            information between parties as a JSON object.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(13)">
          What is the purpose of ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)?
          <div id="answer-13" class="answer">
            ORM allows developers to interact with a database using an
            object-oriented approach rather than writing raw SQL queries.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(14)">
          Explain the concept of load balancing.
          <div id="answer-14" class="answer">
            Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple
            servers to prevent overloading and improve response times.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(15)">
          What is the difference between vertical and horizontal scaling?
          <div id="answer-15" class="answer">
            Vertical scaling increases the capacity of a single server, while
            horizontal scaling adds more servers to handle increased load.
