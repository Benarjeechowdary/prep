          What are the key responsibilities of a data analyst?
          <div id="answer-1" class="answer">
            A data analyst is responsible for gathering, cleaning, and
            interpreting data to help business decision-making.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(2)">
          Explain the difference between structured and unstructured data.
          <div id="answer-2" class="answer">
            Structured data is organized and stored in a fixed format (e.g.,
            tables), while unstructured data lacks a predefined format (e.g.,
            text, images).
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(3)">
          What are some common data cleaning techniques?
          <div id="answer-3" class="answer">
            Removing duplicates, handling missing values, correcting data types,
            and removing outliers.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(4)">
          How do you handle duplicate data in a dataset?
          <div id="answer-4" class="answer">
            Remove duplicates using SQL queries or Python functions like
            `drop_duplicates()` in pandas.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(5)">
          Explain the difference between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN in SQL.
          <div id="answer-5" class="answer">
            INNER JOIN returns only matching rows, while OUTER JOIN returns all
            rows from one or both tables even if there's no match.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(6)">
          What is the purpose of normalization in databases?
          <div id="answer-6" class="answer">
            Normalization reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity by
            organizing data into related tables.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(7)">
          How do you deal with outliers in a dataset?
          <div id="answer-7" class="answer">
            Use statistical methods like Z-score, IQR, or remove them if they
            are erroneous.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(8)">
          What are the different types of data visualization techniques?
          <div id="answer-8" class="answer">
            Bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, and pie charts.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(9)">
          How do you measure the effectiveness of a data visualization?
          <div id="answer-9" class="answer">
            Evaluate clarity, accuracy, engagement, and ease of interpretation.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(10)">
          What is the difference between correlation and causation?
          <div id="answer-10" class="answer">
            Correlation indicates a relationship between two variables, while
            causation means one variable directly affects the other.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(11)">
          How would you perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)?
          <div id="answer-11" class="answer">
            Analyze data distribution, identify missing values, spot patterns,
            and visualize relationships using plots.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(12)">
          What is A/B testing and why is it important?
          <div id="answer-12" class="answer">
            A/B testing compares two versions of a variable to determine which
            performs better, helping in data-driven decisions.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(13)">
          How do you analyze time-series data?
          <div id="answer-13" class="answer">
            Use techniques like decomposition, smoothing, and forecasting models
            (e.g., ARIMA).
          </div>
        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(14)">
          Explain the importance of SQL in data analysis.
          <div id="answer-14" class="answer">
            SQL is used to query, manipulate, and analyze data stored in
            relational databases.

        </li>
        <li onclick="toggleAnswer(15)">
          What are the key differences between Excel and SQL for data analysis?
          <div id="answer-15" class="answer">
            Excel is ideal for small datasets and quick analysis, while SQL
            handles large datasets and complex queries more efficiently.
