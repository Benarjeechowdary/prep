          What are the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases?
          <div id="answer-3" class="answer">
            SQL databases are relational and structured, while NoSQL databases
            are non-relational and flexible with dynamic schemas.

          What is the purpose of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)?
          <div id="answer-5" class="answer">

          What are microservices and how are they different from monolithic
          architecture?
          <div id="answer-6" class="answer">
            Microservices are small, independent services that communicate with
            each other, while monolithic architecture combines all components
            into one codebase.

          <div id="answer-7" class="answer">
            Synchronous programming blocks execution until a task completes,
            while asynchronous programming allows other tasks to continue during
            execution.

          What is an API gateway and why is it important?
          <div id="answer-8" class="answer">
            An API gateway handles requests and routes them to the appropriate
            microservice while managing authentication and rate limiting.

          What is the difference between client-side and server-side rendering?
          <div id="answer-9" class="answer">
            Client-side rendering happens in the browser using JavaScript, while
